As i develop this game project using Javascript and API, My testing was making sure every line of the code properly functioning, looking for errors and adjusting until the code ran without any issues. This process allowed me to learn more in depth on how to work codes with Javascript and API. 

#### Manual testing:

* The HTML code was validated with: [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)
* The Javascript code was validated with: [jshint](https://jshint.com/)

    * Safari
    * Google Chrome
    * Mozilla Firefox
    * Internet Explorer

### Bugs:

When the browser first load the page an error message is logged to the console stating (in Promise) that the play() failed in load request. The user needs to interact with the page first for the autoplay function triggers and the sound will play. 

Error messages are logged to the console when the game start for the high scores function.

All the errors does not affect in any way the user experience game play.
