## Testing:

As i develop this game project using Javascript and API, I tested every line of the codes and making sure the codes was functioning properly, looking for errors and adjusting until the code ran without any issues. This process allowed me to learn more in depth on how to work codes with Javascript and API. Halfway thru the development of my game, I was informed about a modern way of requesting data from an API, Using JavaScript fetch API function and ECMAScript 6/ES6 as i still using the old method of XHR http request. Resulting i need to redo some of my codes and made a lot of testing and adjustment to make sure the game works properly.  

#### Manual testing:

* The game play functionality was tested manually multiple times on different scenerios.

    * Start of the game to input Name And open modals
        - The game required a codename to start the game. changing from windows.onload to jQuery was tested for glitches or attempt override by the player. 
        - Modals open and close smoothly and tested for different devices. 
    * Game Timer
        - Was adjusted from 10 seconds to 15 seconds as the time is not enough from the reviews i gathered from people who played the game while maintaing the suspense of the game.
    * Game Music
        - Was tested for every aspect of the games and how was affecting the game challenges and created a button on/off for people who have sound sensitivity and can be played at night time without disturbing anyone.
    * Game Scores
        - Was tested for continuos progress of the money prize and to show the progress of the player.
    * Game Questions
        - Codes was change from XHR https request to fetch Api, The array for questions was tested if the question was properly showing. I adjusted requesting 10 questions originally to 13 questions. 13 Question was more balance given i add a function of StrikeOut where a player has a 3 ahc wrong answers will end the game.
    * Game Answer buttons
        - Tested for Disabling and enabling for a given period of time and properly showing the multiple choices and randomly putting the right answer within the 4 options.
    
* The HTML code was validated with: [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)
* The Javascript code was validated with: [jshint](https://jshint.com/)
* The website was tested on the following browsers:
    * Safari
    * Google Chrome
    * Mozilla Firefox
    * Internet Explorer

#### Further testing:

I asked my family, friends and fellow students on slack using #peer-code-review for any issues they can find and what the page looks to their mobile and desktop devices. All the issues they found was already fix and tested again.

## Bugs:

When the browser first load the page an error message is logged to the console stating (in Promise) that the play() failed in load request. The user needs to interact with the page first for the autoplay function triggers and the sound will play. 

Error messages are logged to the console when the game start for the high scores function.

TopScore saving function for Topscore button on the landing page are disable on mobile phones and tablets as the function

Mobile phones and Tablets access to Topscore list are disabled as the program uses local storage of a browser. When the game played in the said devices it doesn't use/access a browsers local storage to save scores. 

All the errors does not affect in any way the user experience game play.

On the process of developing this project builds up my confidence on solving logical problems around JavaScript and API's pushing my knowledge further and help me understand how the codes work.
