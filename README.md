Money Heist quiz game is an interactive game I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as the Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project.

The Money Heist quiz game concept and design was based on the popular tv show Money Heist. This game was build for educational purposes only.

Thank you for visiting my Github page and playing my game. I hope you enjoy reading about the project below. Please feel free to contact me for any questions and suggestions. You can message me through my Github page. Have a nice day and enjoy playing my Money Heist quiz game.

## UX (User Experience):

### Project Goals:

The goal of this project, from the concept of the tv show Money Heist, is to give the user an interactive, challenging and suspenseful quiz game. The project is based on general knowledge questions, suitable for all ages. The game needs to be visually close to the design of the show to encourage more user interaction, generating interest for continued use of the game, whilst also providing a good user experience.

The main goal of making the project <strong>Money Heist Quiz Game</strong> is to be developed by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and to use API for external files for the gameplay.

#### Target Audience Goals:

The game aims to be played by all age groups.

#### User Goals:

## Testing:

As I developed this project game using JavaScript and API, I tested every line of the codes and made sure the codes were functioning properly, looking for errors and adjusting until the code ran without any issues. This process allowed me to learn more in depth on how to work codes with JavaScript and API. Halfway through the development of my game, I was informed about a modern way of requesting data from an API by using JavaScript fetch API function and ECMAScript 6/ES6, as I was still using the old method of XHR http request. This resulted in me needing to redo some of my codes and I did a lot of testing and made adjustments to make sure the game worked properly.  

#### Manual testing:

* The game play functionality was tested manually multiple times on different scenarios.

    * Start of the game to input Name And open modals
        - The game required a codename to start the game. changing from windows.onload to jQuery was tested for glitches or attempt override by the player. 
        - Modals open and close smoothly and tested for different devices. 
    * Game Timer
        - Was adjusted from 10 seconds to 15 seconds as the time was not enough from the reviews I gathered from people who played the game while maintaining the suspense of the game.
    * Game Music
        - Was tested for every aspect of the games and how it affected the game challenges, and I created an on/off button for people who have sound sensitivity so the game could be played at any time without disturbing anyone.
    * Game Scores
        - Was tested for continuous progress of the money prize and to show the progress of the player.
    * Game Questions
        - Codes were changed from XHR https request to fetch Api. The array for questions was tested if the question was properly showing. I adjusted from 10 questions originally, to 13 questions. 13 questions was more balanced given that I added a function of StrikeOut, where a player has a chance of 3 wrong answers that will prompt game over.
    * Game Answer buttons
        - Tested for disabling and enabling for a given period of time and properly showing the multiple choices and randomly putting the right answer within the 4 options.
    
* The HTML code was validated with: [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)
* The JavaScript code was validated with: [jshint](https://jshint.com/)
* The website was tested on the following browsers:
    * Safari
    * Google Chrome
    * Mozilla Firefox
    * Internet Explorer

#### Further testing:

I asked my family and friends for any issues they could find and what the page looked and felt like on their mobile and desktop devices. All the issues they found were fixed and tested again.

## Deployment:

Money Heist Quiz Game was developed in Visual Studio Code, while git and GitHub were used for version control and to host the repository respectively.

#### The following steps were taken to deploy Money Heist QuizGame on GitHub Pages:

* Navigated to [GitHub](https://github.com/) in the browser
* Signed in to my account
* Selected my <strong>repositories</strong>.
* Navigate to <strong>'/johndbigboi/MoneyHeist-QuizGame/'</strong>.
* In the top navigation clicked <strong>'settings'</strong>.
* Scrolled down to the <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> area. 
* Selected <strong>'Master Branch'</strong> from the <strong>'Source'</strong> dropdown menu.
* Clicked to confirm my selection.
* <strong>MoneyHeist-QuizGame</strong> now live on GitHub Pages.
* Following these steps, <strong>MoneyHeist-QuizGame</strong> was deployed live on GitHub Pages [here](https://johndbigboi.github.io/MoneyHeist-QuizGame/)

#### Cloning Money Heist QuizGame from GitHub to Run Locally:

* Navigate to <strong>'/johndbigboi/MoneyHeist-QuizGame/'</strong>.
* Click the green <strong>'Clone or Download'</strong> button.
* Copy the <strong>url</strong> in the dropdown box.
* Using your favourite <strong>IDE</strong> open up your preferred <strong>terminal</strong>.
* Navigate to your desired file location. 
* Copy the following <strong>code</strong> and input it into your terminal to clone MoneyHeist QuizGame.
 
 ```
  git clone https://github.com/johndbigboi/MoneyHeist-QuizGame.git
   ```
   
## Bugs:

In todays browsers, when the browser first loads the page, an error message is logged to the console stating (in Promise) that the play() failed in load request. The user needs to interact with the page first for the autoplay function triggers and the sound will play. 
* I developed a modal to interact first on window page load. Then on closing the modal, the game music will play without errors in the console.

Mobile phones and tablets access to Topscore list on the landing page are disabled as the program uses local storage of a browser. When the game is played on the said devices it doesn't use/access a browser's local storage to save scores. 

All the errors do not affect in any way the user's game experience.

## Closing Notes:

Through the process of developing this project my confidence in solving logical problems around JavaScript and API's increased, pushing my knowledge further and this helped me understand how codes work.
